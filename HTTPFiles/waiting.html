        <h1>The game is starting soon...</h1>
        <p>This page will automatically disappear and be replaced with the game once the game starts. For now, we must wait.</p>
        <p>Also, this is a prototype page! It will need to be changed later to include more information about the game yet to be and to be less bland.</p>
